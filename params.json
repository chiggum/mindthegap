It vectorizes bitmaps (currenlty supports png only) without introducing gaps or overlaps between adjacent areas.\r\n\r\n- Authors: Dhruv Kohli, Dr. Rembrandt Bakker, Dr. Piotr Majka\r\n- Mentoring Organization: International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility\r\n- [Link](https://github.com/chiggum/Vectorization-of-brain-atlases) to GSoC'14 project: Real-time Vectorization of brain atlases\r\n\r\nComparison\r\n------------\r\nA comparison between currenlty most popular open source tracing software, AutoTrace and our tracing software, mindthegap.\r\n\r\n![Input bitmap image](https://chiggum.github.io/mindthegap/docs/atlas_219.png \"Input bitmap image\")\r\n![Autotrace output](https://chiggum.github.io/mindthegap/docs/output.svg \"Autotrace output\")\r\n![mindthegap output](https://chiggum.github.io/mindthegap/docs/mindthegap.svg \"mindthegap output\")\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------\r\n**How to use**\r\n- For Linux: `make -f makefile`. The binary will be generated in `bin` directory.\r\n- For windows: Directly use exe file in `exe` directory.\r\n\r\nUse `mindthegap -h`, for further help.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n-----\r\nIf the input image is such that different regions of the image can have multiple shades of same color then use the noisy switch by `-z`.",
